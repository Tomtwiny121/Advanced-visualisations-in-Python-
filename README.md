# Advanced Visualizations in Python

**Â© ExploreAI Academy**

In this training, we will use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create a variety of visualizations in Python. We will gain insight into slicing Pandas DataFrames to create advanced visualizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you should be able to:

- Navigate a Pandas DataFrame.
- Slice a Pandas DataFrame.
- Produce advanced visualizations in Python.

## Exploring the Data

In this notebook, we will learn how to work with Pandas DataFrames and perform some advanced visualizations to draw insights. We'll demonstrate this by working through an example.

Let's start by importing the libraries we're going to need and loading a dataset about football players and their statistics.
